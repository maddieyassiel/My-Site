    <h3><p>Biography:</p></h3>
    <h4><p>My name is Madelaine Murray and I'm from Miami Florida. I'm currently in the 12th grade at Coral Reef Senior High. The classes I'm taking this year are all honors except my electives which are AP Calculus and AP Government. I've been taking Honors since the 6th grade and I've also done AP Psychology and AP Spanish my junior year. Fun Fact, I became an aunt at the age of seven and now has two nephews by the name of Anthony and Jonathan and a niece by the name of Milania. Also, my ethnicity is Panamanian from both sides her family.</p></h4>
    <h4><p>To describe my personality, I would say that I'm quiet and shy when around new people but I have a bad case of RBF to the point that some teachers think that I hates their class.
    Yet, generally I can say that I'm nice, with a hint of sarcastic and sassiness once you get to know me. Three words I would use describe myself is hard working, reliable, and determined. In my spare time, I like to spend it with family if not go outside and swim which is a way of destressing myself.</p></h4>
    <h4><p>When I graduate my plans after high school is to join the Air Force and be in the reserve while taking college classes and majoring in something from the business field. But, what I see myself doing in 5 to 10 years is traveling to Dubai and Europe.</p></h4>
